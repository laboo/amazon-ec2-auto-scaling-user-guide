## Sign Up for AWS<a name="sign-up-for-aws"></a>

When you create an AWS account, we automatically sign up your account for all AWS services\. You pay only for the services that you use\. You can use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling at no additional charge beyond what you are paying for your EC2 instances\.

If you don't have an AWS account, sign up for AWS as follows\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and then choose **Create an AWS Account**\.
**Note**  
This might be unavailable in your browser if you previously signed into the AWS Management Console\. In that case, choose **Sign in to a different account**, and then choose **Create a new AWS account**\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad\.

AWS sends you a confirmation e\-mail after the sign\-up process is complete\.
